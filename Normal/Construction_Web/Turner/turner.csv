The Verdesian is the first multi-family, residential high-rise building in the United States to achieve Platinum LEED status.
Among the building's many environmental features are an HVAC system that conditions fresh air introduced into each apartment, exceeding New York City energy efficiency standards by almost 40%, and a natural gas micro-turbine that produces 70 kilowatts of electric power, lowering peak electric demand by 65%. Heliostats (rooftop mirrors) automatically track sunlight and redirect it to the neighboring park. The building is also linked to an existing black water treatment plant, which recycles water from bathrooms and kitchens to re-supply toilets and provide make-up water for the HVAC system cooling tower. It also harvests rainwater and stores 10,000 gallons of recycled water for irrigation for the ""green"" rooftop garden, which itself provides an important layer of insulation for the building.
The Verdesian uses flat-plate concrete floor construction, which offered an unrivaled speed of construction, at two days per floor cycle.

The structural frame, standing 598 feet tall, is enclosed with a panelized glass curtain wall systemÂ and stainless steel diagrid cladding. The triangulated steel frame uses 21% less steel than a traditionally framed building, saving 2,000 tons of steel.
Turner was also selected for the 650,000 square foot interior fit-out of 34 floors at Hearst Tower, which included 17 floors of fit-out for Hearst publishing subsidiaries, a 10th floor data center and a 13th floor fitness center. For the 28th floor tenant, Good Housekeeping Magazine, the scope of work included labs, test kitchens and dining rooms. The fit-out also included three floors of high end executive offices, an executive conference center, a dining room and a working kitchen.
Hearst Tower is the first commercial building in the United States to receive the Green Building tax credit, and is also registered as a New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA).

"Designed by signature architect, Rafael Vinoly, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute is a life sciences research campus made up of a web of buildings which follow the natural contours of the site. The centerpiece building, a 610,000 square foot research building, is terraced into the hillside and features a 180,000 square foot landscaped roof garden. Additionally, the project included a conference hotel, townhouses and apartments for researchers and visitors.
The challenge for the research building was its shape: rather than constructing the building on an open field, the designers created a three story, S-shaped structure. The facility incorporated structural glass, including three 900-foot long corridors with glass at the front, back and roof.
The entire campus project was built using a phased construction schedule, beginning with the research building, followed by the hotel and residential projects. All phases were completed at the same time.

"Referred to as â€œa building hung between two buildings,â€?the 240,000 square foot Norm Maleng Inpatient Expansion provides various medical services and access to opposite sides of the Harborview Medical Center campus. The 70-foot long skybridge is the scenic anchor for the hanging expansion building below and is made from monolithic metallic trusses that traverse Ninth Avenue.
The Harborview expansion project originally faced tough questions about its size and scope and was scrutinized by local leaders. However, Turnerâ€™s BIM coordination was invaluable in helping determine how the mechanical, electrical and plumbing infrastructure systems would fit within the Maleng Building expansion (which relied on an unconventional construction sequence of building from top to bottom). Additional detailing and communication between subcontractors was necessary to provide shock absorption for the suspended structure and account for future threats of seismic activity.

Logistical issues had to be addressed as well as structural ones, because hospital operations remained at 98% capacity during construction, Turner worked diligently to coordinate visitor/ambulance arrivals and Life Flight helicopter landings to minimize traffic flow disruptions.
The Harborview Medical Center Inpatient Expansion Building received a â€œBuilding of Americaâ€?Award which represents the best in construction and honors the regionâ€™s most innovative, unique and challenging projects.","Client: King County/Harborview Medical Center

"Starbucks Center consists of several interconnected buildings built between 1915 and 1974. Combined they total more than two million square feet of office, retail, and warehouse space. Our project consisted of the replacement of the entire exterior wall for the 1945 building, which is the centerpiece of the complex. The exterior wall was severely compromised during the Nisqually earthquake of 2001.
This complex nine-month eight-phase project replaced the buildingâ€™s original unreinforced masonry with metal stud walls, laid-up brick, and a prefabricated Barkshire panelized system. Installing panelized brick vs. laid-in-place brick on the majority of the building allowed for a faster and less expensive re-skin. Panelized portions of the work accommodated the schedule requirements, job costs, and limited the down time of a major transmission line along the West and East elevations. In order to complete the reskin, Turner built temporary, but â€œpermanent-lookingâ€?walls five feet inside the exterior wall to minimize the noise, add security, and allow tenants to continue to occupy space. The project was completed on time, under budget, while occupied by more than 2,000 employees on a daily basis.","Client: Unknown

"The Niarchos Foundation-Rockefeller River Campus adds two acres to the Rockefeller Universityâ€™s East Side Manhattan footprint by erecting a 900-foot, three-story structure over the FDR drive
a major traffic artery that sees more than 175,000 cars per day and runs along the edge of the East River. The bridge-like structure was prefabricated in 19 sections and barged to the site from 32 miles away in New Jersey. Each prefabricated module was shipped with two levels of concrete slab, lighting, and fire suppression services for over the roadway, as well as necessary connections for existing buildings on campus, and installed overnight using a barge crane.
Planned for more than a year, each of the 19 midnight installations was a carefully orchestrated sequence that took into account the tide, which rises and falls approximately three-feet, and the river current, which flows at approximately six miles per hour, in addition to more traditional coordination considerations. Once complete, the platform will serve as the foundation for three buildings: a two-story 136,000 square foot research facility, a 20,500 square foot Health and Wellness Center, and a 5,000 square foot Interactive Conference Center.
The project also includes rehabilitation of the seawall and upgrades to the public esplanade adjacent to the campus.

"Turner has a history of providing quality district-wide construction management agent services to Livingston Public Schools. Â On this multi-year assignment, Turner was hired to provide support from preconstruction and bidding & award through construction for facility upgrades at eight separate sites.
The projects, funded through public referendum and state grants includes a wide variety of improvement.Â  Key portions of the work at the six elementary schools and two middle schools includes new roofs, new windows and upgrades to the existing mechanical and electrical systems.Â  The project also includes required ADA upgrades to elevators and stair wells.
Photovoltaic solar panels are being installed at nine schools in the district encompassing 290,000 square feet of roof area.

The hospital includes emergency care, interventional care, imaging and surgery, including two new towers of private patient rooms.Â  Additional family support space includes waiting areas, food services, and a patient library.
The University of KentuckyÂ Patient Care Facility Pavilion A is part of the academic medical campus, which will include additional research buildings, a new shared health Sciences Learning Center, and additional buildings to house the programs of the colleges of medicine, dentistry, nursing, and health.
Turner Logistics provided equipment for the patient care facility, Albert B. Chandler Hospital,Â at the University of Kentucky. Equipment included an uniterruptible power supply system, switchboards, panelboards and control centers. Other upgrades included additional ICU beds, acute care beds, emergency department spaces and build outs in emergent radiology areas.
Turner alsoÂ took advantage of BIMâ€™s capabilities to streamline the prefabrication of materials and coordinate a smooth field work flow. Prefabrication is the process of assembling structural components in a factory or other manufacturing site, and then transporting them to the construction area.
Turnerâ€™s BIM engineers teamed with MEP subcontractors as part of their construction management services for the ten-level 1,300,000 square foot patient care facility. During the infrastructure planning stages, electrical conduit/piping was assembled and shaped off-site and then delivered to the jobsite just in time. The BIM virtual renderings also enabled subcontractors to resolve any design inconsistencies and identify the exact locations for pipe and ductwork hangers.
The adoption of prefabrication principles made it possible for Turner to establish a budget that was $3 million under the ownersâ€?initial target.","Client: The University of Kentucky

"The 720,000 square foot academy for the New York City Police Department (NYPD) unites all the NYPDâ€™s training resources, and makes the campus the most advanced, self-contained police training facility in the world.
Situated on 35 acres, the academy is composed of a 350,000 square foot academic building with administrative and faculty offices; a 240,000 square foot physical training center with a special tactical gymnasium, a central utility plant, and more.
One of the projectâ€™s unique features is an LED light sculpture by artist Erwin Redl that animates the space from the inside and out, enhancing the structureâ€™s sense of transparency and openness to the community.
To ensure the projectâ€™s overall success, Turner employed an integrated project delivery system, bringing the stakeholderâ€™s management teams together in one central on-site location for the duration of the project. This approach allowed for seamless collaboration, which was paramount given the changing needs of the police and city agencies. As well, the site required extensive environmental remediation. To overcome this challenge and safeguard the projectâ€™s schedule, excavated materials were analyzed for reuse on the site, rather than being shipped to a landfill. This not only eliminated truck traffic and air pollution but also mitigated various public health concerns.
With the academy completed on-schedule, the academy graduated its first class of cadets in May, 2015. The project was named among Engineering News-Record's 2016 Best Projects.","Client: NYC Department of Design and Construction

"The restoration of the United States Capitol Dome was completed by a joint-venture of Turner Construction and Smoot Construction. The Dome was constructed of nearly 10 million pounds of cast iron more than 150 years ago. Due to constant exposure to the elements, the Dome had begun to deteriorate structurally and cosmetically since the first, and last, time it was restored in 1960. The Turner-Smoot project consisted of repairing more than 1,000 cracks to restore the Dome to a watertight enclosure and included the restoration, repair, and replacement of cast iron and ornamentation. The exterior lead paint was removed and new coatings were applied to protect the Dome from corrosion and effects from the elements. The project required a complete scaffold system(25 levels and over 1.2 Million pounds) around the exterior of the Dome, as well as in the Rotunda where additional restoration work was completed.","Client: Architect of the Capitol

"At 73 stories, the Wilshire Grand Center is the latest addition to the Los Angeles skyline and the tallest building in America, west of the Mississippi river.
It features 900 luxury hotel rooms and 20 floors of rentable, Class-A offices; more than 45,000 square feet of restaurant and upscale retail space; a 70th-floor sky-lobby with a signature observation deck and pool with sweeping views; a variety of innovative public plazas and gathering spaces for visitors and locals alike; and below-ground parking for 1,250 cars.
In addition to the retail, restaurants, cultural and nightlife attractions that make the Wilshire Grand Center a destination in itself, it also offers visitors pedestrian-friendly access to a burgeoning downtown, as well as convenient connections to local and regional transit.

From foundation to spire, the Wilshire Grand Center sets records â€?and standards â€?for construction.

The foundation for the Wilshire Grand Center set a Guinness World Record for the longest continuous concrete pour, running more than 20 hours.
Beginning at 5:00pm on February 15, 2014 and continuing throughout the night and next day, Turner conducted an elaborate symphony of 400 workers, eight batch plants, 19 concrete pumps, and 208 mixers to place more than 2,000 truckloads â€?or 21,600 cubic yards of concrete. The resulting mat foundation is 18 feet thick and weighs more than 82 million pounds.

The Wilshire Grand Center is features a hybrid technology which uses a combination of structural steel, reinforced concrete and what are known as Buckling Restraint Braces (BRBâ€™s) to resist high lateral forces â€?such as those that act upon a high-rise building in an earthquake. The BRBs absorbs seismic forces and work with what are called belt trusses, which go around the buildingâ€™s perimeter, to prevent both buckling and twisting under severe ground motion.

Built offsite, 700 prefabricated bathroom pods were trucked to the site six at a time, hoisted into place, and bolted down the same day. The process saved time, money and trips up and down the hoist with material. In addition to these savings, factory building conditions are safer and more controlled, which facilitates high-quality, consistent work, and is easier on the trade contractors doing the assembly.

The project team at the Wilshire Grand Center earned Golden Gate recognition from Cal/OSHA for their site safety program.Â The Golden Gate partnership recognition program supports and motivates teams that partner pro-actively with the Cal/OSHA Consultation Service on the development of their site-specific safety plans.

The 73-story Wilshire Grand Center is the tallest building in the West, with its iconic curved roof and spire reaching 1,100 feet into the air.
Even as we recognize that a finished project is greater than the sum of its parts, as builders, we think the parts are pretty impressive. For example, the Wilshire Grand Center represents the work of more than 2,200 people over 257 weeks, who put in place more than 22,000 tons of steel, more than 55,000 cubic yards of concrete, and 500,000 square feet of glass. The result is a technologically sophisticated, sustainable tower.

"This 206,000 square foot retail store was built on a 20-acre site. Along with a second Turner built store in Texas, the two stores were the first of their kind and served as a prototype for Wal-Mart. The design intent was to integrate multiple experimental green features and test their efficiency and effectiveness over time. Wal-Mart envisioned an experimental green building that could generate a substantial portion of energy from renewable sources as well as provide a healthy work and shopping environment for its associates and customers.

During an extensive preconstruction period, Turner collaborated with Wal-Mart and the design team to evaluate a variety of sustainable construction ideas. The teamâ€™s research, resulted in a sustainable design that reflects the ownerâ€™s expectations for a high-performance building. The facade is broken up by entry vestibules with 35-foot-tall clerestories that rise out of the low roof section, creating light beacons at night to lead customers to the building entries. Green screens on three sides of the garden center, and four facades give the building shade, ventilation, and a living edge. The rear of the building has a solar wall to preheat outside air. The interior of the store benefits from natural daylight from the building entry vestibules, three 450-foot-long north-facing rooftop clerestories, and skylights. Additional green features include waterless urinals, a 50kw wind turbine, porous paving, many recycled materials, PV panels, bio fuel/waste oil boilers, radiant flooring, and an absorption chiller.","Client: Walmart

"Designed by signature architect, Rafael Vinoly, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute is a life sciences research campus made up of a web of buildings which follow the natural contours of the site. The centerpiece building, a 610,000 square foot research building, is terraced into the hillside and features a 180,000 square foot landscaped roof garden. Additionally, the project included a conference hotel, townhouses and apartments for researchers and visitors.
The challenge for the research building was its shape: rather than constructing the building on an open field, the designers created a three story, S-shaped structure. The facility incorporated structural glass, including three 900-foot long corridors with glass at the front, back and roof.
The entire campus project was built using a phased construction schedule, beginning with the research building, followed by the hotel and residential projects. All phases were completed at the same time.

The center will house the Gates Vascular Institute, theÂ University at Buffaloâ€™s Center for Clinical and Translational ResearchÂ and a biosciences incubator.
Building Information Modeling was an essential tool on Turnerâ€™s recently completed Gates Vascular Institute project in downtown Buffalo.Â  Our primary use of BIM was for coordination of mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and fire protection systems.Â  Modern BIM tools allowed us the ability to identify conflicts that existed between the various building systems associated with the project prior to construction. Typically, these conflicts arenâ€™t realized until construction is well under way causing delays and costly changes.Â  Once identified, all conflicts (referred to as clashes) were reviewed and addressed by the BIM Coordination team with the end result being a â€œclash freeâ€?model.Â  This model was then used by Turner and our subcontractors for final fabrication and installation of building systems in the field.Â  Several benefits were realized on this project from the utilization of the 3D model for coordination:
BIM was also used extensively for planning associated with change orders, particularly those driven by the selection of medical equipment.Â  In certain cases, such as medical equipment, where technology moves at a rapid pace, it is most beneficial to the Owner to have the ability to make just-in-time decisions.Â  However, due to the schedule and phasing of a typical construction project, certain infrastructure requirements for medical equipment that had not yet been selected needed to be set as a basis of design and installed early in the project.Â  Utilizing the BIM model, Turner was able to work with select medical equipment manufacturers to develop a mutually beneficial plan which allowed for an expedited schedule while minimizing the impact to previously installed work, and still providing the Owner with a state-of-the-art space.","Client: Kaleida Health

"Designed by signature architect, Rafael Vinoly, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute is a life sciences research campus made up of a web of buildings which follow the natural contours of the site. The centerpiece building, a 610,000 square foot research building, is terraced into the hillside and features a 180,000 square foot landscaped roof garden. Additionally, the project included a conference hotel, townhouses and apartments for researchers and visitors.
The challenge for the research building was its shape: rather than constructing the building on an open field, the designers created a three story, S-shaped structure. The facility incorporated structural glass, including three 900-foot long corridors with glass at the front, back and roof.
The entire campus project was built using a phased construction schedule, beginning with the research building, followed by the hotel and residential projects. All phases were completed at the same time.

"The Level 5 Procedure Rooms at Virginia Mason make up a 15,000 square foot procedure floor that combines the hospital's gastroenterology, interventional radiology and cardiology departments. Uniquely, the floor -- which includes 11 outpatient procedure rooms and 18 admit/recovery rooms -- is located entirely underground, with the only above-ground access provided through a shaft installed to move materials and equipment. The team was charged with building in flexibility for future changes to care delivery, as procedures move more towards an integration of techniques. The project includes three c-arms,Â one single plane,Â one biplane, 12 admit recovery rooms, andÂ one ultrasound room.
Using an Integrated Project Delivery model, the project team was able to work with the hospital staff, including doctors, nurses, staff, designers, and subcontractors to virtually design and construct the entire project prior to beginning construction.Â  This allowed Turner to reduce the construction schedule from 10 months toÂ four months, saving more than $500,000 in supervision costs and productivity alone.","Client: Virginia Mason Medical Center

Located on 11th Avenue between 58th and 59th streets, the college's new facility provides all the functions of a traditional campus within a single city block while adding classrooms, laboratories, auditoriums, faculty offices, and student lounges.
The presence of Amtrak trains under the southwest corner of the site forced the structural engineers, Leslie E. Robertson Associates, to come up with an unusual structural system for John Jay College's tower building. The top nine floors of the building are hung from steel outrigger trusses that are supported by the building's structural core. As a result, these upper floors have no traditional perimeter columns; instead, smaller hanger rods support the floors. The lower five floors of the building are supported by a conventional steel frame structural system.
Elements of public programs such as the bookstore/cafe, child care center, and a computing hub are located at the street level in order to activate the pedestrian and community activity.","Client: Dormitory Authority of the State of New York

"The Suzzallo Library at the University of Washington consists of four buildings built over a period of several decades; the first was originally constructed in 1925, comprising the wing that faces Red Square; a 1935 wing that faces Mary Gates Hall; a 1947 addition; and a 1963 addition. The phase I renovation of Suzzallo Library is the first of a three-phase master plan addressing critical structural, mechanical, electrical and life safety deficiencies, as well as limited priority program elements.
The first phase addressed critical life safety concerns. It included seismic upgrade of the entire library building and additions, elevator renovations and the addition of a fire suppression system. The remainder of the first phase concentrated on the 1925 building and the 1935 addition, and consisted of mechanical and electrical upgrades, cleaning and sealing of the exterior envelope and a new electrical substation in the 1963 addition.Â  Code compliant exit routes from the 1935 addition and from the North and South ends of the Suzzallo Reading Room were constructed.
Because of the significant role Suzzallo plays in the Universityâ€™s research and teaching mission, the library had to stay in operation throughout the duration of the renovation. Due to limited relocation space for both staff and books, the renovation took place in three phases over a two-year construction period. Displaced library functions were continued in remote locations and returned to Suzzallo upon completion of construction in each phase. Other library functions continued adjacent to on-going construction. In addition, the project is located in the heart of the campus. Limited construction site access, material and restricted construction periods were required to maintain safe and effective operation of the library by students, faculty and the general public.","Client: The University of Washington

"The Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Federal Office Building project included 550,300 square feet of renovations and upgrades including partial demolition of original spaces, installation of glazing, concrete in-fill, addition of granite and metal panel exterior, landscaping, installation of an upgraded fire alarm system and electrical/mechanical systems. Work also included architectural upgrades, glass curtain walls on each end of the building and projected window bays on the north and south facades. The updated space accommodates 2,000 federal employees.
The original eight story structure, previously a highly compartmentalized laboratory facility, has been transformed into a naturally lit and open-planned office space with a few simple yet precise architectural decisions. Two atria were cut into the floor plate, the east and west walls were cut open and the North- South window treatment was reworked to flood the interior with daylight without compromising the structure. All building systems were re-engineered to provide high performing and energy efficient operations. The site has been completely reinvented with a pedestrian-friendly landscape affording environmental benefit as well as perimeter security protection.
The project scope included demolition of the buildingâ€™s core, HAZMAT abatement, installation of granite and metal panel exterior, new glazing, concrete in-fill, new electrical, mechanical, fire alarm and security systems, landscaping, and interior fitout. Improvements to the original building include a glass-encased entry atrium and security screening pavilion, large glass windows, a 100-foot core atrium spanning from basement to new roof skylight, a communicating central stair from the basement to the sixth floor, a large central skylight as well as a green roof and enhanced security.

Located within the confines of NYUMLCâ€™s active healthcare campus, Turner managed a myriad of site logistics. Work was carefully planned around the hospitalâ€™s on-going operations, to ensure patient, staff and visitor safety. To construct the Tisch Elevator, the team cut through an existing retaining wall and created a foundation that measures 15-feet in-depth. To ensure the structureâ€™s integrity and offset potential lateral load from high cross-winds, the superstructure was seismically detailed and features structural steel special moment frames (SMF) and unique shear walls. To support the new elevator tower, extensive MEP upgrades were completed and a double-ended substation concrete vault was also built for a future transformer.","Client: New York University

"Known as The Tata Innovation Center and located on New York City's Roosevelt Island, Cornell Techâ€™s innovative, 240,000 square foot corporate collocation building aims to foster dialogue between private industry and academia, and to accelerate the pace of innovation at Cornell Tech.
That unique mission is reinforced and reflected by the building layout and crystalline structure, which promote interaction, transparency, and engagement between all building occupants. The structure features cantilevered southwest and northeast wings, wrapped in a unitized curtain wall that feature unique â€œfinsâ€?and frit-patterned glass accentuating the triangular glass form.
To realize the cantilevered wings, the project team crafted a series of temporary steel structures on which load bearing trusses were erected. Once the trusses were in place, the temporary supports were removed, allowing for the construction of the wings.Â  During the entire process Turner, in close collaboration with projectâ€™s engineer, constantly surveyed the site to ensure the elevated structure settled according to strict specifications.

"At 73 stories, the Wilshire Grand Center is the latest addition to the Los Angeles skyline and the tallest building in America, west of the Mississippi river.
It features 900 luxury hotel rooms and 20 floors of rentable, Class-A offices; more than 45,000 square feet of restaurant and upscale retail space; a 70th-floor sky-lobby with a signature observation deck and pool with sweeping views; a variety of innovative public plazas and gathering spaces for visitors and locals alike; and below-ground parking for 1,250 cars.
In addition to the retail, restaurants, cultural and nightlife attractions that make the Wilshire Grand Center a destination in itself, it also offers visitors pedestrian-friendly access to a burgeoning downtown, as well as convenient connections to local and regional transit.

From foundation to spire, the Wilshire Grand Center sets records â€?and standards â€?for construction.

The foundation for the Wilshire Grand Center set a Guinness World Record for the longest continuous concrete pour, running more than 20 hours.
Beginning at 5:00pm on February 15, 2014 and continuing throughout the night and next day, Turner conducted an elaborate symphony of 400 workers, eight batch plants, 19 concrete pumps, and 208 mixers to place more than 2,000 truckloads â€?or 21,600 cubic yards of concrete. The resulting mat foundation is 18 feet thick and weighs more than 82 million pounds.

The Wilshire Grand Center is features a hybrid technology which uses a combination of structural steel, reinforced concrete and what are known as Buckling Restraint Braces (BRBâ€™s) to resist high lateral forces â€?such as those that act upon a high-rise building in an earthquake. The BRBs absorbs seismic forces and work with what are called belt trusses, which go around the buildingâ€™s perimeter, to prevent both buckling and twisting under severe ground motion.

Built offsite, 700 prefabricated bathroom pods were trucked to the site six at a time, hoisted into place, and bolted down the same day. The process saved time, money and trips up and down the hoist with material. In addition to these savings, factory building conditions are safer and more controlled, which facilitates high-quality, consistent work, and is easier on the trade contractors doing the assembly.

The project team at the Wilshire Grand Center earned Golden Gate recognition from Cal/OSHA for their site safety program.Â The Golden Gate partnership recognition program supports and motivates teams that partner pro-actively with the Cal/OSHA Consultation Service on the development of their site-specific safety plans.

The 73-story Wilshire Grand Center is the tallest building in the West, with its iconic curved roof and spire reaching 1,100 feet into the air.
Even as we recognize that a finished project is greater than the sum of its parts, as builders, we think the parts are pretty impressive. For example, the Wilshire Grand Center represents the work of more than 2,200 people over 257 weeks, who put in place more than 22,000 tons of steel, more than 55,000 cubic yards of concrete, and 500,000 square feet of glass. The result is a technologically sophisticated, sustainable tower.

"Constructed for the development firm, Hines, 7 Bryant Park is a 30 story 474,000 sf office tower, boasting a unique conical design and a curtain wall system. To ensure the projectâ€™s timely completion, Turner successfully managed the Tower's core-first construction approach. The building's core, comprised of 950 tons of rebar and 9,200 cubic yards of concrete, was erected by using Tru-lift, a self-climbing system of steel grid supports and hydraulic jacks that enabled Turner to pour and set four floors per day. In addition, concrete, iron, and elevator subcontractors were meticulously coordinated to ensure the prompt â€œchasingâ€?of the core. During construction, Turner implemented a strict site management program to safeguard the nearby thoroughfare and the surrounding neighborhood, one of the busiest in Mid-town Manhattan.

7 Bryant Park offers tenants outstanding amenities such as a fitness center, a rooftop terrace, and direct access to public transportation. In addition, it has been distinguished as New Yorkâ€™s first Wired Certified Platinum building by WiredScore, a service that identifies and certifies the connectivity quality of commercial buildings.

"The 38-story tower at 300 Madison Avenue features 25 floors of office space atop an eight-story podium for a total of 1.2 million square feet.
The podium consists of three trading floors, one technology floor, two office floors and a two story lobby that features a flagship retail boutique currently occupied by Sephora. Below grade are two and one half floors of support space.
To facilitate the construction of 300 Madison, the Turner project team demolished nine buildings, each of which had its own unique connections to public utilities in one of New York City's busiest neighborhoods, near Grand Central Station. Proximity to subway lines meant that the project team had to pre-plan and coordinate its activities with the Metropolitan Transport Authority and other city agencies. The coordination continued well into the foundation phase, as two subway lines, the Times Square Shuttle and 7 Train run directly underneath the north end of 300 Madisonâ€™s foundation. Ultimately, through open communication, diligent pre-planning and effective trade management Turner fast-tracked 300 Madison to completion within an aggressive 26-month schedule. The early completion allowed Brookfield to turnover blocks of floors to tenants in time for planned fit-outs.","Client: Brookfield Office Properties
